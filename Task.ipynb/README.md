ASSESSMENT QUESTION 1
. The Collatz conjecture is a famous unsolved problem in mathematics. The problem is to prove that if you start with any positive
integer x and repeatedly apply the function f(x) below, you always get stuck in the repeating sequence 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, . . .

f(x)={(x√∑2)/(3x+1)         if x is even otherwise

For example, starting with the value 10, which is an even number,
we divide it by 2 to get 5. Then 5 is an odd number so, we multiply by 3 and add 1 to get 16. Then we repeatedly divide by 2 to
get 8, 4, 2, 1. Once we are at 1, we go back to 4 and get stuck in the
repeating sequence 4, 2, 1 as we suspected.
Your task is to verify, using Python, that the conjecture is true for
the first 10,000 positive integers.


EXPLANATION OF THE CODE FOR COLLATZ CONJECTURE

f(x) function:

This function takes an integer x as input.
If x is even (x % 2 == 0), it divides x by 2 (x // 2).
If x is odd, it applies the formula 3x + 1.
The function returns the result of these operations.
collatz(x) function:

This function takes a positive integer x as input.
It uses a while loop to iterate until x becomes 1.
Inside the loop:
It prints the current value of x followed by a comma and a space (, ).
It updates the value of x by applying the f(x) function.
After the loop terminates (when x becomes 1), it prints the final value of x.
The Collatz sequence is a series of numbers generated by repeatedly applying the f(x) function. The conjecture suggests that, regardless of the starting positive integer, this sequence will always eventually reach the value 1. The code essentially prints the Collatz sequence for a given positive integer x until it reaches 1.
